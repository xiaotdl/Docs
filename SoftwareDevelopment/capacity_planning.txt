max qps: any likely increase in workload, peak hours, special events etc.
avg qps: normal workload


Methodologies:
* Service-starvation analysis
  * scale down service until a failure

* Load-generation analysis
  * scale up traffic until a failure

* Static-resource analysis
This approach involves identifying the most constrained system resource for a given service tier (typically, CPU, memory, disk space, or network I/O) and determining what percentage of that resource is available to the service as its currently deployed.


Planning:
* calculate each serviceâ€™s free capacity, say(20%)
* the safest minimum amount of free capacity, say(10%)
 * Free capacity is your buffer against unexpected workload spikes, server outages, or performance regressions in your code.
