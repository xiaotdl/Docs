- First Normal Form (1NF):
    A table is 1NF if every cell contains a single value, not a list of values.
- Second Normal Form (2NF):
    A table is 2NF, if it is 1NF and every non-key column is fully dependent on the primary key.
    Furthermore, if the primary key is made up of several columns, every non-key column shall depend on the entire set and not part of it.
- Third Normal Form (3NF):
    A table is 3NF, if it is 2NF and the non-key columns are independent of each others.
    In other words, the non-key columns are dependent on primary key, only on the primary key and nothing else.
