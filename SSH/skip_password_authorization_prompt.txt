== ~/.ssh/authorized_keys (Server-Side Files) ==
authorized_keys is a one-key-per-line register of public ECDSA, RSA, and ED25519 keys that this account can use to log in with. The file's contents are not highly sensitive, but the recommended permissions are read/write for the user and not accessible by others. The whole key including options and comments must be on a single, unbroken line.

In short, the authorized key entry (client-side pubkey) make sure that client can login to the server without prompting password.


== 'password' authorization prompt ==
(ite)vagrant@xili-dev-fit-win-2:~/p4/tmos-tier2/TrafficShield/autotest/tests/bin$ ssh root@10.192.10.136
Password:


== Solution to skip 'password' authorization prompt ==
# copy client's pubkey(id_rsa.pub) to server's .ssh/authorized_keys file
user@host:~$ sshpass -p 'default' ssh-copy-id root@10.192.10.136
Now try logging into the machine, with "ssh 'root@10.192.10.136'", and check in:

  .ssh/authorized_keys

to make sure we haven't added extra keys that you weren't expecting.

# login without 'password' prompt
user@host:~$ ssh root@10.192.10.136
