## 2.3 **Operators** and **Motions** 

  d motion

  Where:
    d      - is the delete operator.                             
    motion - is what the operator will operate on (listed below).

  A short list of motions:                                              
    e - to the end of the current word, INCLUDING the last character.   
    w - until the start of the next word, EXCLUDING its first character.
    $ - to the end of the line, INCLUDING the last character.           

NOTE:  Pressing just the motion while in Normal mode without an operator will 
       move the cursor as specified.                                          

## 2.4 Using a Count for a Motion
2w: move the cursor two words forward.

## 2.5 Using a Count to Delete More

  The format for a change command is:                               
            operator   [number]   motion                            
  where:                                                            
    operator - is what to do, such as  d  for delete                
    [number] - is an optional count to repeat the motion            
    motion   - moves over the text to operate on, such as  w (word),
               $ (to the end of line), etc.
