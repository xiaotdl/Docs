If the CPAN client is too old, we might need to install a newer version.
== Install from cpan shell ==
  New CPAN.pm version (v2.10) available.
  [Currently running version is v2.05]
  You might want to try
   > install CPAN
   > reload cpan
  to both upgrade CPAN.pm and run the new version without leaving
  the current session.
== Compile from source ==
