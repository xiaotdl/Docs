Python has a very useful easy_install command which can download and install 3rd-party libraries with a single command. This is provided by the “setuptools” project: https://pypi.python.org/pypi/setuptools.

To install setuptools, download https://bitbucket.org/pypa/setuptools/raw/bootstrap/ez_setup.py and save it somewhere. After download, invoke the command prompt, go to the directory with ez_setup.py and run this command:

	C:\> python ez_setup.py

Now setuptools and its [easy_install] command is installed. From there we can go to the Sphinx install.

>>Installing Sphinx with easy_install

If you finished the installation of setuptools, type this line in the command prompt:

	C:\> easy_install sphinx

After installation, type “sphinx-build” on the command prompt. If everything worked fine, you will get a Sphinx version number and a list of options for this command.

That’s it. Installation is over.
